Tea and biscuit hunting
Opps are good at nothing
There ain't no discussing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Shoot man up, in London
Ain't no repercussions
See the feds, we rushing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Tea and biscuit hunting
Opps are good at nothing
There ain't no discussing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Shoot man up, in London
Ain't no repercussions
See the feds, we rushing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Can't even call my opps opponents
They lack vital components
Come 'round here, ain't no postponements
Load that gun, shoot back in moments
Gunshots so potent, have man scurry away like rodents
And then back to the country house
Got to throw a party with the Tory donors
Love Thatcher, she's got it
Like Shakespeare, write her a sonnet
Come 'round with a blacked out Bentley
One shot, leave an opp dead on the bonnet
Astonished, offshore accounts, fresh deposits
Man go quick like Sonic
We always gotta make that profit
Opps all know we have a plan
Windsor Castle, where we hang
They never come 'round here, 'cause we defend our land
Pull up with the gang, gang
Pull up, let it bang, bang
Opps all scared, when we pull up with the gang, gang
Tea and biscuit hunting
Opps are good at nothing
There ain't no discussing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Shoot man up, in London
Ain't no repercussions
See the feds, we rushing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Tea and biscuit hunting
Opps are good at nothing
There ain't no discussing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Shoot man up, in London
Ain't no repercussions
See the feds, we rushing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Ooh, y'know, this-this beat is hard
I think we should have a- a dance break, or something, y'know
Sounds good
Left, right, left, right, y'know
It's brilliant, isn't it
Thank you Grayto for making the beat
But I can't be asked to write anymore lyrics, y'know
My brain is past its due-by date
Y'know Boris, like yours? No no no, Boris, I'm joking
I love you, and I love David Cameron
And the dance break is over in three, two, one, and
Tea and biscuit hunting
Opps are good at nothing
There ain't no discussing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Shoot man up, in London
Ain't no repercussions
See the feds, we rushing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Tea and biscuit hunting
Opps are good at nothing
There ain't no discussing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
Shoot man up, in London
Ain't no repercussions
See the feds, we rushing
Grab your guns, 'cause the brits are coming
What a spliffing song that was, y'know
Rule Britannia and all, God save the queen
Good work lads, good work
Onto the next one, yes
